## ‚ú® What's New in Version 0.8.4 ‚ú®

* **üçÖ Introducing Tomato Clock (Pomodoro Timer):**

We're excited to announce a brand-new addition to **Focus Flow Monitor** designed to boost your productivity even further: the **Tomato Clock**!

Many of you know this technique as the Pomodoro Timer ‚Äì a proven time management method that breaks down work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Our integrated Tomato Clock brings this power directly into your workflow.

### What you can do with the new Tomato Clock:

* **Stay Focused:** Work in timed sessions (defaulting to 25 minutes) to maintain high concentration.
* **Take Regular Breaks:** Reminds you to take short breaks (5 minutes) and longer breaks (15 minutes) to rest and recharge.
* **Classic Pomodoro Flow:** Follows the standard cycle: Work -> Short Break -> Work -> Short Break -> Work -> Short Break -> Work -> Long Break.
* **Easy Controls:** Start, pause, reset the current timer, or switch to the next phase directly from the popup.
* **Visual Cues:** The current phase and remaining time are clearly displayed in the popup. The extension icon badge also updates dynamically to show the active timer and its current phase color.
* **Desktop Notifications:** Get notified when a work session or break is complete, so you know when it's time to switch gears. You can easily toggle these notifications on or off from the popup.

### How to use it:

1.  Click on the Focus Flow Monitor icon in your browser toolbar.
2.  You'll find the "Tomato Clock" section right in the popup.
3.  Click "Start" to begin your first work session!

We believe this feature will be a great companion to the existing time tracking and site blocking capabilities, helping you manage not just *where* you spend your time, but *how* effectively you use it.

Give the new Tomato Clock a try and let us know what you think! Your feedback is always welcome.

## Installation

Get the latest version from the official Firefox Add-ons page:

[**Install Focus Flow Monitor for Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/focusflow-monitor/)

---

## Usage Notes

-   **Tracking Inactivity:** To accurately capture activities like video watching or reading, tracking pauses only when you're inactive (no mouse or keyboard input) for a duration you can configure (default is 30 minutes; options range from 1 minute to 1 hour, or can be disabled).
-   **Accessing Options Page:** You can access detailed statistics, manage categories, set site rules (including schedules and block page customization), and configure all settings via the extension's options page.
    -   Right-click the extension icon in the Firefox toolbar ‚Üí "Manage Extension" ‚Üí "Preferences/Options" (‚öôÔ∏è icon).
    -   Alternatively, click the gear (‚öôÔ∏è) icon in the extension popup.
-   **How to use üçÖ Tomato Clock:**
    -    Click on the Focus Flow Monitor icon in your browser toolbar.
    -    You'll find the "Tomato Clock" section right in the popup.
    -    Click "Start" to begin your first work session!
    -    A Pomodoro cycle consists of 4 work sessions, with a short break after each of the first 3 sessions, followed by a long break at the end. The timer will automatically guide you to the next stage‚Äîfor example, after completing a work session, it will prompt you to start the short break. However, you're free to manually switch between timers if you prefer.
    -    The remaining time will appear in the toolbar if the extension is pinned: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64ac383c-0406-4b57-b7ed-da80108d9b83). If you want **Focus Flow Monitor** to notify you when the timer ends, the extension will need notification permissions. You can grant this by clicking the bell icon in the popup which will take you to Tomato Clock settings on the Options page.

-   **Active Development:** Focus Flow Monitor is actively maintained and improved. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
