**Track your time online, gain insights, and stay productive.**

Understand your online habits and stay productive by tracking the time you spend on different websites. Set limits or block specific URLs or categories—like restricting your most distracting site to 30 minutes a day or blocking it entirely.
Note: To better capture focused activities like video watching, tracking continues unless you are inactive (no mouse or keyboard use) for 30 minutes.

**Privacy-first by design.**

No tracking or analytics—your data stays local, stored entirely in your browser.

**Actively evolving.**

The app is under active development, so features may change over time.
